# What is Gradient Descent?



## Exposition

## Formulate problem

## Derivation


## Why Gradient Descent?

# Examples + Code


## Quick example from homework


## Strongly Convex function

"Maybe some numerical experiments illustrating the convergence properties of applying gradient descent on a strongly convex function."


# When it doesn't work / setbacks

## Issues with gradient descent

## Function it doesn't apply to / violates assumptions




# Alternatives

## Newton / Quasi-Newton Methods
