Part 1:

2) In the majorization step, why (theta + epsilon)/2(\sqrt{\tilde{\theta}+\epsilon}) > \sqrt{\theta + \epsilon} ? I don't see any reason for being that true. I am deducting point for that, if you think it is true, explain me, I will be happy to add points back.

5) You can't say from the argument that the function is strongly convex, because the m that you choose if dependent on the diagonal entries of W which depends on beta. so the choice of m depends on beta. But to show strong convexity, you need to take an m which is independent of beta. 

Actually, you don't need strong convexity here, strict convexity and coercivity is enough to ensure unique global minimum

6) You have talk about why algorithm map is continuous and the fact that all fixed points are stationary points and stationary point is unique.

Part 2:

In the newton_step_naive and smw function, you added a -negative sign to the output of solve, which I couldn't understand why.
